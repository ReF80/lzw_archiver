What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.

summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks.

The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course,

Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping.

in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me.

Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me!

I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most

exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks.

beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really

but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping.

Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping.

boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren

love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want,

summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks.

The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course,

Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping.

in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping.

of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all,

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me!

I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most

schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks.

beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really

but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every

summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping.

boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren

love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want,

What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course,

Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping.

in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping.

of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all,

Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most

schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks.

beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I 
remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

remember best about this journey is my first experience of scuba diving!

If you want my advice, always use your time to do something good, pleasant or 
beneficial! Dont waste it to sleep too long or surf useless social networks. 
The world is full of great things you can learn or experience. Go forward!

Yeah.., and Id like to add, that Im happy to be back to school! I loved my 
summer holidays and had a great rest so Im eager to go back to my studies again.What is summer for you? As for me, its the time for doing what I want, 
exploring something new, enjoying every second of warmth! I know that most 
schoolchildren 
love summer because they want to do nothing. But thats not about me! 
I love doing something interesting, unusual and even challenging. In 
summer I have enough time for all these!

If you want, Ill tell you about my summer in details. First of all, 
Id like to say that I like to get together with my friends. In my 
opinion its cool to be in a good company. I have two best friends 
and most of the summer I spent with them.

Im lucky that my friends spend holidays at the same village as me. 
Our grandparents live nearby in the countryside. All June and August 
I spent there. My friends and me love to start the morning with a long bike ride.

At midday we usually sunbath and swim in the lake. There are hundreds 
of activities for us to try, for example, playing badminton, fishing, 
boating, picking berries and more. By the way, we help our grandparents 
in the garden and around the house. And in the evening we go camping. 
Its my favourite part of the day! We enjoy sitting by the fire and cooking
potatoes. Several times we even slept in the tent. It was like small adventures!

In July my parents took vacation and we went abroad. We travel almost every 
summer. Its something like a small family tradition. This time we went to 
Montenegro. My mum is fond of going sightseeing. Its not my passion, of course, 
but sometimes it can be fun. What is good is getting new impressions! I really 
like to see new cities, try unusual food, communicate with people of other 
cultures. To be honest, I prefer swimming in the sea to sightseeing. What I
